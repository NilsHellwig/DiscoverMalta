# About Us

## Information

"We have had the opportunity to visit the great historical monument to the art of Theodor Adorno. It stands on a small island on the sea. Its size made the place unenjoyable. But even now, when our guests are in the midst of making their very last steps in Theodor Adorno's life, they are waiting with a great desire for it to close. The great museum is a magnificent thing. For a while we felt that we would be unable to give full satisfaction to these people."
